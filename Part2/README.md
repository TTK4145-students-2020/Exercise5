# Writing elevator code

Write code that interface the elevator over TCP. You will need to write code for all the functions you intend to use. Remember to think about what kind of interface you want for your module. Should the module require polling or should it be possible to subscribe to events from the module?

When you're finished writing the driver you will need to test the functionality before including it in your project. Test on the simulator while coding and then verify your driver on the actual elevator after.
