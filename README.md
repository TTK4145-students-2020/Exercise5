# Exercise 5: Call for transport

If you have completed the last assignment you will already have a working network module. This means that som parts of this exercise will be familiar to you as the elevator hardware exposes a tcp interface.

## Parts
- [Part 1: Testing the simulator](./Part1/README.md)
- [Part 2: Using the simulator to test your program](./Part2/README.md)
- [Part 3: Running your code on actual elevator HW](./Part3/README.md)
- [Part 4: Completing the abstraction](./Part4/README.md)


## Approval
This exercise does not require excplicit approval as it's implicitly improved when you complete the project.
